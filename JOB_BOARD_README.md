## Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: MongoDB URI is currently hardcoded. In production, use environment variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://ai:Ai123@cluster0.fwwaouj.mongodb.net/
   ```

2. **File Storage**: Currently using base64 encoding. For production, consider:
   - AWS S3 for file storage
   - Cloudinary for image processing
   - File size limits and virus scanning

3. **Authentication**: Current auth is basic. For production, implement:
   - JWT tokens with proper expiration
   - Password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Rate limiting
   - Session management

4. **Email Notifications**: Add email functionality for:
   - Application confirmations
   - Admin notifications
   - Status updates
